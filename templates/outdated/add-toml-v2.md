# Add pyproject.toml for Custom Node Registry

We are building a global registry for custom nodes (similar to PyPI). The registry makes using custom nodes more reliable by reserving globally unique names for each custom node, and supporting semantic versioning.

Hereâ€™s some [more information](https://comfydocs.org/registry/overview#introduction) on the registry.

Action Required:

- [ ] Go to the [registry](https://comfyregistry.org/). Login and create a publisher id. Comment it here and we will update the PR (or just merge it and change it yourself).
- [ ] Write a short the description.
- [ ] Merge the separate Github Actions PR and run the workflow.

If you want to publish the node manually, [install the cli](https://comfydocs.org/comfy-cli/getting-started#install-cli) and run `comfy node publish`
