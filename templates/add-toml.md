# Add pyproject.toml for Custom Node Registry

We are working with dr.lt.data and comfyanon to build a global registry for custom nodes (similar to PyPI). Eventually, the registry will be used as a backend for the UI-manager. All nodes go through a verification process before being published to users.

The main benefits are that authors can
- publish nodes by version and users can safely update nodes knowing ahead of time if their workflows will break or not
- automate testing against new commits in the comfy repo and existing workflows through our CI/CD dashboard

Action Required:

- [ ] Go to the [registry](https://registry.comfy.org). Login and create a publisher id (everything after the `@` sign on your registry profile). 
- [ ] Add the publisher id into the pyproject.toml file.
- [ ] Merge the separate Github Actions PR, then merge this PR.

If you want to publish the node manually, [install the cli](https://docs.comfy.org/comfy-cli/getting-started#install-cli) by running `pip install comfy-cli`, then run `comfy node publish`
