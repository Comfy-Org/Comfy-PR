# Update PyProject Toml - License

Hey! HaoHao from [comfy.org](https://comfy.org/) again üòä.

As a heads up, the `license` field is **optional** but in the case that it is filled out, the license file should be referenced as follows
- `license = { file = "LICENSE" }` ‚úÖ 
- `license = "LICENSE"` ‚ùå

This was brought up in our discord and so we're creating a small PR to update that optional field. For more info check out toml file [standards](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#license) or our [docs](https://docs.comfy.org/registry/specifications#license) page!
